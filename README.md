# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created as a resource to help other aspiring web developers learn the tools of the trade. The study guide is a simple user friendly website that allows people to study information about web development. During this project I learned how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript as a way for users to effectively engage with an educational website.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used as a way for users to study notes on HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git. If the user is having a hard time decicing what to study they may open up the console using the Chrome DevTools (Command+Option+I FOR MacOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows) which will guide them towards which subject to study first.
